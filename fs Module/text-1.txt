The important bit to understand right up front is that Node is a “JavaScript runtime”. When JavaScript was first created, it was designed to run in the browser. This means that it was impossible to use JavaScript to write any kind of program that was not a website. Node brings JavaScript out of browser-land. This allows developers to use JavaScript to accomplish pretty much anything that other popular server-side languages such as Ruby, PHP, C# and Python can do. So, at its most basic level, Node allows you to run JavaScript code on a machine such as your local computer or a server without having to go through a web browser.

To facilitate this, Node has some added functionality that is not found in browser-based JavaScript, such as the ability to read and write local files, create http connections and listen to network requests.
